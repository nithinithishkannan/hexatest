📝 Blog Management System - Full Stack Project
This documentation describes the Blog Management System, a full-stack web application developed using Django (Python) for the backend and Angular for the frontend. The system enables users to create, edit, delete, comment on, and filter blog posts by genre or tag. It’s designed to provide a smooth, responsive, and interactive experience for both readers and writers.

1. 🔍 Overview
The Blog Management System is a dynamic platform where users can manage content effectively. The system supports typical CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts, accompanied by user interaction through comments and genre-based filtering.

User Roles:

Admin or authenticated users can create, edit, and delete blog posts.

All users can view posts and add comments.

Main objectives:

Provide an intuitive UI for content management.

Facilitate categorization of posts via genres or tags for easy filtering.

Enable readers to engage with content by commenting.

2. ⚙️ Technologies Used
Backend (Python / Django):
Django 4.x: Robust Python web framework to build secure and scalable backend APIs.

Django REST Framework: Simplifies building RESTful APIs with serializers and viewsets.

MySQL / SQLite: Relational database for storing posts, comments, and tags. SQLite is recommended for development/testing; MySQL for production.

dj-database-url: Helps configure databases via environment variables, improving deployment flexibility.

django-cors-headers: Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow frontend requests from Angular app.

Frontend (Angular):
Angular CLI 16+: Command-line interface for generating Angular projects and components.

Angular Components: Modular pieces of UI controlling different views and logic.

Angular Services (HttpClient): Manages HTTP requests to the backend APIs, keeping logic separated from components.

HTML5 + CSS3: Structure and styling of the user interface.

3. 🚧 Backend Setup (Django)
3.1 Install Dependencies
Install all required Python packages to set up the Django project environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install Django>=4.0,<5.0
pip install pymysql
pip install dj-database-url
pip install django-cors-headers
pip install djangorestframework
pymysql enables MySQL connectivity from Django.

django-cors-headers is crucial to avoid CORS errors when Angular frontend tries to communicate with Django backend.

3.2 Project Structure
The backend follows a modular structure:

bash
Copy
Edit
backend/
├── Schoolproject/            # Main project folder (contains settings.py, urls.py)
└── student/                  # Core Django app for blog management
    ├── models/
    │   ├── blogpost.py       # BlogPost model defining blog post fields
    │   ├── comments.py       # Comment model for post comments
    │   └── tag.py            # Tag model for categorizing posts
    ├── views.py              # API views handling HTTP requests
    └── urls.py               # URL routes connecting endpoints to views
This organization keeps concerns separated, improving maintainability.

3.3 Migration and Run Server
To prepare and start your Django app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py makemigrations    # Create migration files based on models
python manage.py migrate           # Apply migrations to the database
python manage.py runserver         # Start local development server
4. 📃 Models and Database Schema
The data structure includes three primary models:

4.1 BlogPost Model
Represents a blog post with:

title: Short text string (max 255 characters) for the post title.

content: Long text field containing the main post content.

genre: ForeignKey relation to the Tag model (categorizes the post).

created_at: Timestamp automatically set when the post is created.

python
Copy
Edit
class BlogPost(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    content = models.TextField()
    genre = models.ForeignKey('Tag', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
4.2 Comment Model
Stores comments users make on blog posts:

post: ForeignKey linking comment to a specific BlogPost.

text: The comment text content.

created_at: Timestamp for when the comment was posted.

python
Copy
Edit
class Comment(models.Model):
    post = models.ForeignKey('BlogPost', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    text = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
4.3 Tag Model
Defines tags or genres to classify blog posts:

name: Name of the tag/genre (e.g., "Technology", "Lifestyle").

python
Copy
Edit
class Tag(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
Tags help users filter posts by topics of interest.

5. 📊 API Endpoints and Functionality (views.py)
This backend exposes RESTful APIs to interact with the data:

HTTP Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/blog-posts/	Retrieve all blog posts
GET	/blog-posts/{id}/	Retrieve single post by ID
POST	/blog-posts/	Create a new blog post
PUT	/blog-posts/{id}/	Replace full blog post content
PATCH	/blog-posts/{id}/	Partial update on blog post
DELETE	/blog-posts/{id}/	Delete a blog post
POST	/comments/	Add a comment to a post

Each endpoint maps to Django views that handle validation, database queries, and response formatting.

6. 📁 Frontend Setup (Angular)
6.1 Angular Project Creation
Create a new Angular project and navigate inside it:

bash
Copy
Edit
ng new student1-frontend
cd student1-frontend
6.2 Component and Service
Generate the blog post UI component and API service:

bash
Copy
Edit
ng g component blog-post
mkdir src/app/services
ng g service services/api
blog-post component manages the blog-related UI and interaction logic.

api.service.ts encapsulates all backend HTTP calls for reuse.

6.3 Folder Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
src/app/
├── blog-post/
│   ├── blog-post.component.ts    # Component logic (TypeScript)
│   ├── blog-post.component.html  # Component template (HTML)
│   └── blog-post.component.css   # Component styles (CSS)
└── services/
    └── api.service.ts            # API service handling HTTP requests
7. 🎨 BlogPost Component Details
This Angular component is the core UI piece for interacting with blog posts.

blog-post.component.ts
Handles:

Form Binding: Binds title, content, and genre inputs to component variables using Angular forms.

API Calls: Calls API service to fetch, create, update, and delete posts.

Filtering: Filters displayed posts based on selected genre.

Comments: Manages adding and displaying comments for each post.

blog-post.component.html
Contains:

Input Form: Fields for post title, content textarea, and genre dropdown selection.

Buttons: Save, Edit, and Delete buttons with appropriate event bindings.

Comments Section: Textarea/input and submit button to add comments per post.

Filter Dropdown: Dropdown menu to select genre/tag filter to dynamically show posts.

8. 🔗 API Service Integration (api.service.ts)
The Angular service simplifies backend communication:

typescript
Copy
Edit
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class ApiService {
  private baseUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000';

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getAllPosts() {
    return this.http.get(`${this.baseUrl}/blog-posts/`);
  }

  getPostById(id: number) {
    return this.http.get(`${this.baseUrl}/blog-posts/${id}/`);
  }

  createPost(data: any) {
    return this.http.post(`${this.baseUrl}/blog-posts/`, data);
  }

  updatePost(id: number, data: any) {
    return this.http.put(`${this.baseUrl}/blog-posts/${id}/`, data);
  }

  deletePost(id: number) {
    return this.http.delete(`${this.baseUrl}/blog-posts/${id}/`);
  }

  createComment(data: any) {
    return this.http.post(`${this.baseUrl}/comments/`, data);
  }
}
